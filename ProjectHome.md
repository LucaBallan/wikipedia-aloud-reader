Text-to-speech (TTS) software specifically designed for visually impaired and blind people. It provides a voice assisted access to the Wikipedia search engine and reads aloud the found pages.
It is written in C# using the standard Microsoft Speech APIs and the .NET framework 2.0. It parses html and wiki tags, eliminating tables and images, in order to generate an easy to speech text. Source code is available under GNU General Public License.
